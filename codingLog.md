# CODING LOG
## 2017

- ### 20.12.2017
  - Today I applied to renew my passport and identity card. It was a busy morning. After that I need to deal with some task in the job.
  - My daily job takes a lot of time of me.
  - So I couldn't code much. But;
  - I solve an algorithm problem from @freeCodeCamp [Sum of all the odd numbers in a fibonacci sequence to given value](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-of-all-odd-fibonacci-sequence-to-given-value.js)
  - Create 1 new js file which is a solution to a @freeCodeCamp algorithm and update and edit README.md
  - I almost finished the [pomodoro clock](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp) but I decided to do it very simple firstly.
    because I need to learn and read more about js objects.
  - After first version I will improve the [pomodoro clock](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp) eventually.
  #### Pins of the day
  - I like codrops collective. But I first to mention about [30 Seconds of Code](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code). It has very nice code snippets.
  - Today I look up to [Array.reduce() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) in MDN Web Docs. I used it to sum the only odd values in a fibonacci sequence. 
  - Also I use [Array.pop() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop). I just look up to it because of don't make a syntax mistake and be sure about it remove only the last element of the array.
  - Codrops Collective [#374](https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-374/)
  
- ### 19.12.2017
  - I need to deal with my daily job tasks most of the day again.
  - There is a meeting in the deparment about surveying. But at least I've created this log.
  - I create [sum-all-numbers-in-a-range.js](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range.js)
  - and I update the links in the README.md of Algorithms-problem-solving repository.

- ### 18.12.2017
  - I couldn't code today. Because of my daily job tasks.
