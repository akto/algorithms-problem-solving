## 2017

- ### 21.12.2017
  - I created [`where-art-thou.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/wherefore-art-thou.js).
    It's a js code to looks through an array of objects (first argument) and returns an array of all objects that have matching property and value pairs
  - I finished 2 videos on @freeCodeCamp.
  - I solved an algorithm [Sum of the all prime numbers till given value `sum-of-all.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-all-primes.js)
  - I finished the [Pomodoro Clock Apps](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp). It has been challenging for me. Because I had tasks to do in my daily job and gone to the field trips about it. It's very hard to develop something while you are working in a job like that.
  - Maybe I'll seperate background colors of session and break times in the [Pomodoro Clock Apps](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp) later.
  - Today I can say that I am productive. I solved one algorithm, watched 2 vids, finished the pomodoro clock.
  #### Pins of the day
  - I finished video 6-7-8 at [Computer Basics playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmfoj2Th9fvxhHIeqFO7wOy)
  - Check out [Dev Tips Video Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ)
  - Check out to [contribute to the open source projects](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source)
  - Check out - [The startups of TÃ¼rkiye and which technology they use](https://github.com/frontendistanbul/technologies)

- ### 20.12.2017
  - Today I applied to renew my passport and identity card. It was a busy morning. After that I need to deal with some task in the job.
  - My daily job takes a lot of time of me.
  - So I couldn't code much. But;
  - I solve an algorithm problem from @freeCodeCamp [Sum of all the odd numbers in a fibonacci sequence to given value](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-of-all-odd-fibonacci-sequence-to-given-value.js)
  - Create 1 new js file which is a solution to a @freeCodeCamp algorithm and update and edit README.md
  - I almost finished the [pomodoro clock](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp) but I decided to do it very simple firstly.
    because I need to learn and read more about js objects.
  - After first version I will improve the [pomodoro clock](https://codepen.io/egemen/pen/zPzJQp) eventually.
  #### Pins of the day
  - I like codrops collective. But I first to mention about [30 Seconds of Code](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/30-seconds-of-code). It has very nice code snippets.
  - Today I look up to [Array.reduce() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) in MDN Web Docs. I used it to sum the only odd values in a fibonacci sequence. 
  - Also I use [Array.pop() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop). I just look up to it because of don't make a syntax mistake and be sure about it remove only the last element of the array.
  - Codrops Collective [#374](https://tympanus.net/codrops/collective/collective-374/)
  
- ### 19.12.2017
  - I need to deal with my daily job tasks most of the day again.
  - There is a meeting in the deparment about surveying. But at least I've created this log.
  - I create [`sum-all-numbers-in-a-range.js`](https://github.com/akto/algorithms-problem-solving/blob/master/sum-all-numbers-in-a-range.js)
  - and I update the links in the README.md of Algorithms-problem-solving repository.

- ### 18.12.2017
  - I couldn't code today. Because of my daily job tasks.
